# tng-sla-mgmt
The 5GTANGO SP SLA Management repository.  

The SLA Management repository includes the SLAs descriptors and schemata, as well as all mechanisms that need to be implemented. 
   
The schema files are written in JSON-Schema      
   
The mechanisms included in the tng-sla-mgmt include:
*  SLA Template Generator : creates initial and tailored SLA templates for the service provider, and the Ô¨Ånal SLA itself
*  SLA Mapping Mechanism:  mapping between the high-level requirements described by the end-user and the low-level requirements described by the service provider
